            Why build another framework?
        </x-title>

        <x-text>
            I've been trying a few different frameworks and putting things together of our own... it's never how you want it to be. I don't think this will be the perfect
            solution for everyone neither.
            <br />
            <br />
            I really like how Laravel and NestJS work and how you build with them. It inspired me to create something of my own. I originally created a lot of this for a
            hackathon project, but it was actually decent.

            Installation
        </x-title>

        <x-code whitespace="            ">
            npm install @envuso/cli -g
            yarn global add @envuso/cli

            * You can now use "envuso" to create and manage your project
        </x-code>

        <x-title>
            Creating your first project
        </x-title>

        <div class="text">
            If you have installed the CLI tool from above, you can now generate your
            project by running
            <x-code :inline="true">envuso new</x-code>
            and following
            the steps, it should take less than 30 seconds.

            <br>
            <br>

            You can also clone the framework structure and set up everything yourself
        </div>

            Using Envuso CLI
        </x-title>

        <x-code whitespace="            ">
            // Preferred way of creating a project
            npm install @envuso/cli -g
            envuso new
            // You will be taken through a few basic steps
            > ? Project folder name? EnvusoProject
            > ? Your project will be created at: /Users/sam/Code/EnvusoProject
            > Is this okay? (Y/n)
            ? Which package manager do you wish to use?
            npm
            ‚ùØ yarn

            // Your project will now be setup for you :)
        </x-code>

            Doing it yourself
        </x-title>
        <x-code whitespace="            ">
            // You can also do it your self manually
            git clone @envuso/framework my-awesome-project
            cd my-awesome-project
            yarn
            cp example.env .env
            // Set the APP_KEY in .env file, you can self generate a key and add it to your .env file
            > node -e 'console.log(require("crypto").randomBytes(16).toString("hex"))'

            // You're all done :)
        </x-code>

        <x-title>
            Configuration
        </x-title>
        <div class="text">
            You will also need to configure your .env file.
            <br>
            There will be an <strong>example.env</strong> file, which you can copy
            and rename to <strong>.env</strong> you can use
            <x-code :inline="true">cp example.env .env</x-code>
            <br>
            <br>
            You may need to change the following values:
            <br>
            <strong>APP_KEY,  APP_HOST,  CORS_ORIGIN</strong>
        </div>

            Directory Structure
        </x-title>

        <x-text>
            As you can see, you don't start completely from scratch, there is a few
            classes that the framework needs, but this means you're also able to
            customise quite a few things to your liking.
